# Email-Spam-Classifier

The project involves a collection of emails labeled as 'spam' and 'ham' (non-spam), initially stored in a DataFrame. These emails are then processed using CountVectorizer. This data is utilized to train the model, which is subsequently tested for predictions using sample inputs. The Python libraries employed encompass pandas, numpy, io, os, CountVectorizer, and MultinomialNB from sklearn.


1. **scikit-learn:**
   - **Data Preprocessing:** scikit-learn provides a wide range of tools for data preprocessing, including text processing utilities like `CountVectorizer` and `TF-IDF Vectorizer` to convert textual data into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.
   - **Model Selection:** scikit-learn offers a variety of machine learning algorithms suitable for classification tasks, such as Naive Bayes classifiers (`MultinomialNB`), Support Vector Machines (`SVM`), and ensemble methods like Random Forests.

2. **TensorFlow and PyTorch:**
   - **Deep Learning Models:** Both TensorFlow and PyTorch are powerful frameworks for building deep learning models. While they are more commonly associated with tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and sequence-to-sequence tasks, they can also be applied to text classification, including spam classification.
   - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks in TensorFlow or PyTorch can capture sequential dependencies in text data, which is crucial for understanding the context of sentences in emails.
   - **Embeddings:** These frameworks allow the use of pre-trained word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) or training custom embeddings to enhance the model's understanding of the semantic relationships between words.

3. **Overall Workflow:**
   - **Data Splitting:** All three libraries can be used to split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
   - **Evaluation Metrics:** scikit-learn provides metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which can be used to evaluate the performance of both traditional machine learning models and deep learning models.

**Typical Workflow:**
1. Use scikit-learn for initial data preprocessing, feature extraction, and basic machine learning models.
2. For more complex models, leverage TensorFlow or PyTorch to build and train deep learning models, especially if the dataset is large and requires capturing intricate patterns.
3. Evaluate and compare the performance of scikit-learn models with those built using TensorFlow or PyTorch.

This approach allows you to benefit from the strengths of each library, combining traditional machine learning techniques with the expressive power of deep learning for more complex patterns in text data.
